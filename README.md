# Time-series-ENSAE
Repository made for the time series project @ ENSAE ParisTech (penultimate year)

Past deadline: **17th May 2016**.

The goal of this project was to find an industrial production index from the INSEE and to model it by means of an ARIMA (the datasets are available here: https://www.insee.fr/fr/information/2411675). I chose the index concerning the hydrocarbons extraction in France.
